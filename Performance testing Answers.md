Assume you were asked by DuckDuckGo to performance test their application.
 1. You are given a requirement which states 
 "The system should scale to 2000 users".
 what other questions would you need to ask in order to enough information to create a Workload Model.

 If tasked with performance testing for DuckDuckGo's application to ensure it scales to 2000 users, additional questions could include:
 * Search Patterns:
    > what are the expected search patterns of users?
    >Are there common or anticipated search queries that could affect system load?
 * Geographical Distribution:
    > Where are the primary user bases located geographically?
    > Are there any regional differences in user behaviour or search preferences?
 * User Behaviour:
    > What specific actions will users perform within the system?
    > What is the expected distribution of user activities?
 * Concurrency:
    > How many users are expected to be active simultaneously?
    > Are there peak usage times or events that might impact concurrency?
 * Data Usage:
    > What type and volume of data will be processed for each user interaction?
    > Are there any data storage requirements?
 * Performance Expectations:
    > What response time is acceptable for different system functions?
    > Are there any specific performance benchmarks to achieve?
 * Integration:
    > Are there external systems or services that the application needs to integrate with?
    > How will these integrations impact the workload?
 * Mobile and Desktop Usage:
    > what is the ratio of mobile to desktop users?
    >Are there specific performance considerations for mobile users?
 * Caching Mechanisms:
    > what caching mechanisms are in place to optimize search results?
    > How does caching impact performance under varying user loads?
*  User Authentication:
    > Is there a user authentication process, and how does it impact system load?
    > Are there different access levels that could affect performance?
*  API Usage:
    > Does the application rely on external APIs, and how might they influence performance?
*  Future Growth:
    > Is there a projected growth in the number of users beyond the initial 2000?
    > How easily can the system accommodate future scalability needs?

These above questions aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's requirements, user behaviours, performance expectations, which are crucial for developing an effective workload model.

2. Please Rewrite the requirement above so that it testable and more descriptive?
 > The system must successfully handle a concurrent user load of 2000, ensuring responsive search functionality across diverse search patterns with an emphasis on realistic mobile and desktop usage scenarios.
 > The performance testing should enclose various geographical locations, assess the impact of user authentication processes, evaluate caching mechanisms, validate API interactions, future Growth to ensure optimal performance under real-world conditions.

 3. As well as creating a script in a tool to do the performance testing, what other factors would need to be considered for a performance testing engagement?
 * Beyond creating a performance testing java script, additional factors to consider for a performance testing engagement with DuckDuckGo include:
  > Requirements clarification: 
  Ensure that clear understanding of performance requirements, expectations, and any specific scenarios that are critical to the application.
  > Test Data Management:
  Develop a strategy documentation for management test data, including creation, maintenance.
  > Testing Tools Selection:
  Choose appropriate performance testing tools that align with the applications technology and testing objectives.
  > Test Execution Schedule:
  Plan and coordinate the performance testing schedule to minimize disruptions and ensure accurate representation of different usage patterns.
  > Environment Isolation:
  Isolate the performance testing environment to prevent interference from other testing activities or production traffic.
  > Feedback:
  Establish a feedback system for real-time communication between the testing team, development and stakeholders to address issues promptlty.
  > Regression Testing:'
  Perform regression testing alongside performance testing to ensure that performance optimizations do not introduce new issues.
  > User Load Variation:
  Consider scenarios with varying user loads, including ramp-up and ramp-down phases to simulate realistic usage patterns.
  > Third party Dependencies:
  Identify and account for any external dependencies such as third party APIs or services and assess their impact on overall performance.
  > Documentation:
  Document the performance testing process, including test scenarios, configurations and results for future reference and analysis.
  > Scalability Testing:
  Assess the systems ability to scale horizontally or vertically to meet growing demands beyond the current user load.
  Data Privacy:
  Ensure compliance with data protection regulations by securing test data appropriately.

By these above factors the performance testing engagement can be conducted more effectively.
